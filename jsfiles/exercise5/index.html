<!-- 
You can have multiple script tags which get executed one at a time. 
You should put javascript at the bottom. Because the script/alert tag will execute first and then it delays the html and css that is seen by the reader.
Script tag at the bottom - website loads first - no delay. So script tags at the bottom!

Control + shift + i to auto align!
